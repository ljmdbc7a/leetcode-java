     * Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
     * <p/>
     * Example:
     * Given nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2], return [2, 2].
     * <p/>
     * Note:
     * Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
     * The result can be in any order.
     * <p/>
     * Follow up:
     * What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
     * What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
     * What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
     * <p/>
     * 总结：
