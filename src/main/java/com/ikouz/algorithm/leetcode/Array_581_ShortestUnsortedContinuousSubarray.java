/**
 * Given an integer array, you need to find one continuous subarray that
 * if you only sort this subarray in ascending order, then the whole array
 * will be sorted in ascending order, too.

 You need to find the shortest such subarray and output its length.

 Example 1:
 Input: [2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 9, 15]
 Output: 5
 Explanation: You need to sort [6, 4, 8, 10, 9] in ascending order to make
 the whole array sorted in ascending order.

 Note:
 Then length of the input array is in range [1, 10,000].
 The input array may contain duplicates, so ascending order here means <=.
